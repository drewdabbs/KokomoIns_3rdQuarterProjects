                # Description
                These projects are mock-ups of console applications needed to be completed by the end of the year's third quarter.
                These are subsidiaries or in-house businesses of the larger umbrella company, Komodo Insurance.
                
                # Naming Convention
                Each project is named in a way that correlates to the relevant business and business name found in the prompt.
                Note: The number preceeding the project name relates to the number of the prompt and not an enumeration of the projects.
                For example: My third project is for the Komodo Company Outings prompt. This is the fourth prompt in the assignment so begins with '04'.
                
                # Timeliness and Branching
                The assignment was completed slightly early, even considering time to go back through and delete unused lines and code. 
                At the time of original submission all projects functioned correctly, only the CRUD methods called for by the prompt were implemented, and Unit Testing was done on those methods.
                After submission I will branch the solution out so I can give so extra functionality. 
                If I can complete some functionality, test it, and such I will merge the branches.
                For example: Prompt number 2, Komodo Claims Department, does not require the functionality of an Update method.
                A Delete method is likewise a bit moot as .Dequeue is a shorter way to remove rather than writing a method.
                But some functionality and practice could help.
                
                # Takeaway
                I originally set out to try and blaze through three projects so I could include a fourth, be that the bonus or just one other numbered project.
                There were a good number of time setbacks. Prompt number four, Komodo Company Outings, I chose because I thought it looked straightfoward.
                It was not. I learned a lot from it but also learned that I struggle with what wording I need in a google search.
                Most of my questions or errors I googled for that prompt gave me solutions, but they were more advanced than what I was able to udnderstand.
                At one point I implemented a googled fix for an error I was having and through trial and error got it to work.
                But I didn't understand it, so I removed it and kept googling until I found a fix that I did understand.
